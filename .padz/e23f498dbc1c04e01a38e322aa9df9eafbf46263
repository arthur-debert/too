establishing lip balm's role


libpbaml is our  lib for terminial based output rendering which can provide : 

- automatic style applicatoin with lipgloss styles
- markdup syntax for text formatting (<error>{{text}}</error>)
- shell detection and output redirection handling  and shell capabitlity (reich
  term, plain text)
- rendering outptu as json, makdown etc.
- nested templates, etc.
- template management from paths, 


we moved some parts to lipbalm, but others were not. 
we're in the middle of moving to lipbalm what is the generic lib's scope and
removing from too (our app). 


we have just done the code that moves off too/output/renderer.go the template
loading. did we remove from our codebase / adapted the code to use lipbalm for
this?
