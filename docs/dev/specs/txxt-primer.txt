A quick guide to formatting structured text with txxt


1. Sessions and Hierarchy

    Sessions structure your document hierarchically using numbers and indentation.
    Each level needs proper indentation (4 spaces per level).

    
    1.1 Basic Numbered Sessions
    
        Content is indented from the session title.
        
        
        1.1.1 Deeper Nesting
        
            You can go arbitrarily deep with proper indentation.
            
            
        1.1.2 Another Subsection
        
            Sessions at the same level share the same indentation.
    
    
    1.2 Session Title Rules
    
        - Preceded by two blank lines (or use UPPERCASE or ruler ----)
        - Followed by one blank line
        - Numbers can be any style: 1. or 1.1 or a. or i.
    

2. Session Content Formatting

    All content aligns to the session baseline (this indentation level).
    
    Paragraphs sit at the baseline. Multiple paragraphs are separated
    by blank lines.
    
        - Lists are indented +1 from baseline (4 spaces)
        - This prevents ambiguity with dialog dashes
        
        -- code
            // Verbatim blocks also +1 indented
            const example = "txxt format";
        -- javascript
    
    Everything that's not a paragraph needs the +1 indentation.


3. Lists

    Lists must be indented from the session baseline.
    
    
    3.1 Unordered Lists
    
        Basic flat list:
        
            - First item
            - Second item
            - Third item
        
        Nested unordered:
        
            - Fruits
                - Apples
                - Bananas
                - Oranges
            - Vegetables
                - Carrots
                - Broccoli


    3.2 Ordered Lists
    
        Basic numbered:
        
            1. First step
            2. Second step
            3. Third step
        
        Nested ordered:
        
            1. Planning Phase
                1. Requirements
                2. Design
                3. Review
            2. Implementation Phase
                1. Development
                2. Testing


4. Verbatim Blocks

    Code and preformatted text use the -- marker.
    
        -- title goes here
            const greeting = "Hello, txxt!";
            console.log(greeting);
        -- javascript
    
    Parts of a verbatim block:
    
        - Opening marker: -- with optional title
        - Content: indented from the marker
        - Closing marker: -- with optional language
    
    Without language (callout block):
    
        -- Important Note
            Remember to always indent your code blocks
            from the marker line!
        --


5. Inline Formatting

    Text can be formatted inline using simple markers.
    
    *Bold text* uses asterisks - *multiple words work too*.
    
    _Italic text_ uses underscores - _also multiple words_.
    
    You can nest them: *bold with _italic inside_ works*.
    
    References use square brackets:
    
        - Files: [./document.txxt] or [/path/to/file.txxt]
        - URLs: [example.com] or [https://example.com]
        - Sections: [#2.1] refers to section 2.1
        - Footnotes: [1] refers to item 1 in the last section
    
    The word before a reference becomes its anchor text.


Key Differences from Markdown

    - Sessions require double blank lines (not # headers)
    - Lists MUST be indented from baseline
    - Code blocks use -- markers (not ```)
    - No spaces between inline markers and content
    - References are always [bracketed], no (text)[url] syntax
