                # Nested Lists Design Specification

This document outlines the design and behavior of the nested todo lists feature in `tdh`.

## 1. Problem Analysis

A simple, flat list is insufficient for organizing related tasks. Users need the ability to break down larger items into smaller sub-tasks, creating a natural hierarchy. This feature adds this capability while maintaining the speed and convenience of the existing interface.

## 2. Core Design: Data Model and Business Rules

The implementation is built on the following principles:

### Data Model

The `Todo` struct is extended to support a recursive, parent-child relationship. Each todo item contains:

-   **ID**: A permanent, internal UUID.
-   **ParentID**: A UUID referencing the parent's ID. For top-level items, this is an empty string.
-   **Position**: A mutable, user-facing integer that is always relative to its direct siblings.
-   **Items**: An array of child `Todo` structs, allowing for arbitrary nesting.

### Business Rules: A User-Centric Model

The core principle of the system is **preserving user intent**. The status of any given item is explicitly set by the user and is not implicitly altered by actions on its parent. Instead, the *behavior* of other commands changes based on the hierarchy.

1.  **No Direct `delete` or `toggle`**: The workflow for removing items is a two-step process: an item is first marked as `done`, and then a separate `cleanup` command removes all `done` items. This makes completion a non-destructive, reversible action. The ambiguous `toggle` command has been replaced with explicit `complete` and `reopen` commands.

2.  **Behavioral Propagation (Top-Down Effect)**: When a parent item is marked as `done`, the status of its children is **not** changed. Instead, commands that operate on the list treat the `done` parent as a "gate," stopping traversal down that branch.
    -   `tdh ls` (default view): Does not display `done` items or any of their descendants, regardless of the children's status. This matches the user's expectation: "If I'm done with a category, don't show me its contents."
    -   `tdh cleanup`: Removes `done` items and all of their descendants. This also matches user expectation, cleaning up the entire branch at once.

3.  **Bottom-Up Completion (Roll-Up Effect)**: As a quality-of-life improvement, when a user marks an item as `complete`, `tdh` checks the status of its siblings. If all siblings are now `complete`, the parent item is automatically marked as `complete` as well. This recursively applies up the tree.

3. Internal API

    The internal APIs will be updated to handle the new hierarchical structure.

    Item Retrieval:
    
        A central, recursive function, `FindItemByPositionPath(collection, "1.2.1")`, will be the primary mechanism for locating items. It will parse the dot-notation string and traverse the `Items` arrays based on the `Position` field at each level.

    Transactional Integrity:
    
        All operations that modify the tree structure must be performed within a single, atomic `store.Update()` transaction. This guarantees that the data file is never left in a corrupted or inconsistent state.


4. User-Facing API (CLI)

    The command-line interface will be extended to manage the hierarchy, using dot-notation for addressing items.

    Addressing Items:
    
        Users will interact with items using a dot-separated path of `Position` numbers (e.g., `1`, `1.2`, `2.1.1`).

    `tdh add`:
    
        The `add` command will be enhanced with a `--parent` flag to create sub-items:
        
        • `tdh a "New top-level task"`: Adds an item to the root of the list.
        ## 4. User-Facing API (CLI)

The command-line interface is extended to manage the hierarchy, using dot-notation for addressing items.

-   **Addressing Items**: Users interact with items using a dot-separated path of `Position` numbers (e.g., `1`, `1.2`, `2.1.1`).

-   **`tdh add`**: The `add` command is enhanced with a `--parent` flag to create sub-items.
    -   `tdh a "New top-level task"`: Adds an item to the root of the list.
    -   `tdh a --parent 1.2 "New sub-task"`: Adds a new item as a child of the item at position 1.2.

-   **`tdh complete <positions...>`**: Marks one or more items as `done`.
    -   `tdh complete 1.2`: Marks the item at 1.2 as `done`.
    -   This command triggers the "Bottom-Up Completion" logic.

-   **`tdh reopen <positions...>`**: Marks one or more items as `pending`.
    -   `tdh reopen 1.2`: Marks the item at 1.2 as `pending`. This action only affects the specified item.

-   **`tdh move <source> <destination>`**: Restructures the list by moving an item.
    -   `tdh move <source_path> <destination_parent_path>`: Moves an item from its current location to become a child of the destination parent.
    -   `tdh move 2.1.1 1`: Moves the item at 2.1.1 to be the last child of the item at 1.
    -   `tdh move 1.2 ""`: Moves the item at 1.2 to the root of the list.

-   **`tdh ls`**: The list command handles the new hierarchy and respects the "Behavioral Propagation" rule.
    -   `tdh ls`: Renders the indented list of all `pending` items. Traversal stops at any `done` item.
    -   `tdh ls --depth 1`: (Future) Displays only the top-level items.

-   **`tdh cleanup`**: The cleanup command respects "Behavioral Propagation," deleting `done` items and all their descendants.


    `tdh complete <positions...>`:
    
        A new command to mark one or more items as done.
        
        • `tdh complete 1.2`: Marks the item at 1.2 as `done`.
        • Triggers "Bottom-Up Completion" logic if applicable.

    `tdh reopen <positions...>`:
    
        A new command to mark one or more items as pending.
        
        • `tdh reopen 1.2`: Marks the item at 1.2 as `pending`.
        • This action only affects the specified item and does not propagate in any direction.

    `tdh ls`:
    
        The list command will be updated to handle the new hierarchy and respect the "Behavioral Propagation" rule.
        
        • `tdh ls`: Renders the full, indented list of all `pending` items. Traversal stops at any `done` item.
        • `tdh ls --depth 1`: (Future) Displays only the top-level items.

    `tdh cleanup`:
    
        The cleanup command will be updated to respect the "Behavioral Propagation" rule, deleting `done` items and all their descendants.
